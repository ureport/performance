* Experimental notes around poll PERFORMANCE

* Create contacts

** No bulk INSERT
The function just ends up running 180k single INSERT statements and then doing a massive commit.

** Adding categories happens after contacts have been added which means that if adding contacts fails, the categories may not get added

** 


* Suggested improvements

** Add some kind of indicator / message log to the Poll so that we can display to James what has / has not happened

* Research Questions

** How is it possible for it to fail silently on any stage?
