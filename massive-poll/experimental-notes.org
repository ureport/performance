* Experimental notes around poll PERFORMANCE

* Create contacts

** No bulk INSERT
The function just ends up running 180k single INSERT statements and then doing a massive commit.

** Adding categories happens after contacts have been added which means that if adding contacts fails, the categories may not get added

** Transactions seem to be executed on the db around each item
*** Create poll with bulk
*** Add yes / no categories
*** Adding the poll to the site

* Start polls

** Start poll javascript doesn't report an error if it fails (replicate by killing celery)


* Suggested improvements

** Add some kind of indicator / message log to the Poll so that we can display to James what has / has not happened

** Add a "Verify" button to poll to check if it works
** Make send messages a trigger from a button
** Add a poll audit table which records when polls have been executed and verified


* Research Questions

** How is it possible for it to fail silently on any stage?

* Receive responses
